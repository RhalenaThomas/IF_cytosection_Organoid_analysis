# IF_cytosection_Organoid_analysis

1. Developing CellProfiler pipeline to quantify many features of IF cyrosections.  Designed for Midbrain Organoids tiled images from confocal miscropy. Building off of the pipelines made with/by Eddie Cai and Harris Nami.

Developing batch analysis to quantify cells in organoids sections with different stains. Features measured in cell profiler pipeline.Data processing in python.

Measure:
1. number of cells
2. number of neurons, astrocytes, other cells
3. distribition of cell types.
4. network of cell types. 

2. spatial analysis, data exploration and plotly

3. Quantify difference between genotypes.

We will set up and save pipelines set up for specific markers and measurement set ups.
